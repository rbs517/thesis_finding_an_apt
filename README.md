# thesis_finding_an_apt

A chrome extension that scrapes your past orders on Seamless.com as an input to find a perfect apartment on StreetEasy.com

The algorithm uses data from Seamless advertisements on the NYC Subway [created by Liz Loudy](http://www.lizloudy.com/seamless-awards) to determine which neighborhood people should live in based on their food orders. Additionally, the algorithm takes into account how much money you spend on food. If you spend a lot of money on food, you will see more expensive apartments on Streeteasy.

This is a part of my Absurd Algorithms series for my thesis at ITP 2019.
